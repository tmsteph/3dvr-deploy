# 3dvr Deploy

This repository currently ships a static concept page for the upcoming 3dvr self-hosted deploy platform.
Nothing here is live infrastructure yet â€” itâ€™s a mock to help explain the direction while the real tooling is built.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the concept copy and visuals. Edit the file locally and refresh to iterate on the mock.

## Status

- âœ… Static HTML/CSS concept page
- ðŸš§ Actual deploy system, mesh networking, and automation are still under development

Follow along as we replace the placeholders with a genuine self-hosted workflow.
