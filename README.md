# 3dvr Deploy

This repository currently ships a static concept page for the upcoming 3dvr self-hosted deploy platform.
Nothing here is live infrastructure yet — it’s a mock to help explain the direction while the real tooling is built.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the source.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or open it via your browser’s file menu) to load the static mock.
3. Keep the file open in your text editor so you can change the copy, colors, or layout.
4. Save your edits and refresh the browser tab to see them instantly.

### Editing tips

- Any HTML change you make is reflected immediately on refresh—there’s no build step.
- Want live reload? Point a lightweight dev server (like VS Code’s Live Server or `python -m http.server`) at the folder.
- Pair the README with the on-page “How to edit this mock” card for quick reminders.
Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the concept copy and visuals. Edit the file locally and refresh to iterate on the mock.

## Status

- ✅ Static HTML/CSS concept page
- 🚧 Actual deploy system, mesh networking, and automation are still under development

Follow along as we replace the placeholders with a genuine self-hosted workflow.
